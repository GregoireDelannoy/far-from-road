# far-from-road
Find the furthest away spot from any paved road in a geographic area. Hobby project to get back to NodeJS dev.

Demo at http://farfromroad.mooo.com/
To use: zoom to search area and click on button.

Be cautious, as for now only roads in France where loaded into my database. I'll import the others at some point, but OSM raw data is HUUUUGE.
