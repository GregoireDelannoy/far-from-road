# far-from-road
Find the furthest away spot from any paved road in a geographic area. Hobby project to get back to NodeJS dev.

Demo at https://gregoiredelannoy.fr/farfromroad/
To use:
 * Select area (might fail on too very large areas, check console/network logs).
 * Click button to load geographical features (roads and water bodies) from backend.
 * Click the search button to launch client search and display.

Be cautious, as for now only roads in France where loaded into my database. I'll import the others at some point, but OSM raw data is HUUUUGE.
